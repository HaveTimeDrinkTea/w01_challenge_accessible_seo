# w01_challenge_accessible_seo

## Description
This project is part of the Frontend Dev Bootcamp course challenge for week 1. It simulates a on-the-job ticket where a starter code is provided and my role as a developer is to make changes, correct errors or otherwise improve on the code to satisfy client's requirements. 

Through this project, I have an opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of HTML/CSS, the git workflow, github, terminal commands, VSCode and debuging using browser developer mode. I have also had a chance to read up and get a brief understanding of web accessiblity and SEO.

The main user story for this project is to refactor an exisiting site to make it more accessible and optimised for search engines.


### Methodology

* Inspect the various elements in the starter index.html on mainly safari browser.
* Identify areas to be improved or corrected and divide the issues into three main areas. See [Features](#features). 
* Make the changes and follow a git workflow as if I am working in a team of developers.


### Further Works

It is recommended that the webpage should be made to be responsive as the next step. 


## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

The website must meet accessibility standards by having the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible ''alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
